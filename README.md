# SomCSharp
C# Verson of Simple Object Model which is ported from Stefan Marr's som-java 

Please be sure to open project with VisualStudio 2022 which supports C# 10.0 and .NET 6.0.

I didn't have time to check all the functions, therefore it could be bugs in somewhere, let me know if you encounter any bugs.

Please read link about the original java version on 

https://github.com/smarr/som-java

for details.
